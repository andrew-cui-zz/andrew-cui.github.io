- Welcome to my website! This is a project I started in December 2016 without any knowledge of HTML or CSS, and something I've been working on when I have time since while teaching myself the languages as I go.

- In January, I restarted the site to include Bootstrap knowing that it would make the site cleaner to work with. Now, in May, I've revamped the design to take away the black and higher-contrast previous setting in favor of a lighter color scheme.

- 05/26/2017: I've finished adding mostly everything I wanted this time around outside of the "interests" section.

- 06/14/2017: Redesigning website from scratch with Bootstrap 4, having a better knowledge of HTML/CSS development. Trying out new color scheme and design ideas.

- 07/26/2017: I've been working on and off for this, but had an idea for a new, more exciting design - updated as just the landing page for now.

- 08/06/2017: Relaunching new main section of website.

- 10/10/2017: I wasn't satisfied with the design I created last time, since it was too cluttered. I've redesigned it from bottom up - this time, also focusing on better-structured and styled HTML and (especially) CSS. Will be looking to improve performance as well.
